# 📦 Dikshit Singla's Tiny Tapeout Verilog Project

## What is Tiny Tapeout?
[Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com) is an **educational project** that makes it possible for students, hobbyists, and engineers to get their **digital or analog circuits manufactured** as real silicon chips — at very low cost.  
It lowers the barrier for learning and experimenting with **ASIC design and fabrication**.

---

## 🔧 Project Description

This project is part of my personal learning journey in **ASIC design and Verilog development**.  
The design was created using **Verilog HDL** and targets fabrication through the **Tiny Tapeout shuttle program**.  

### **Project Goal:**  
To implement and fabricate a simple digital design to solidify my understanding of RTL-to-GDSII workflows and ASIC hardware design.

> Example project: 4-bit counter, FSM, or a small ALU (you can specify your exact project here)

### **Steps to Use This Project**

1. 🔧 **Edit Verilog Files**
    - Place your Verilog source code in the `src/` directory.

2. ✏️ **Update info.yaml**
    - Fill in:
        - `source_files`: list of your `.v` files.
        - `top_module`: name of your top-level module.
    - Validate the file using [Tiny Tapeout YAML migration tool](https://tinytapeout.com).

3. 📝 **Document Your Project**
    - Edit `docs/info.md` to describe:
        - What your design does.
        - How to test it.
        - Any unique aspects of your implementation.

4. 🧪 **Write & Adapt Testbenches**
    - Place testbenches in `test/`
    - See `test/README.md` for guidance.
