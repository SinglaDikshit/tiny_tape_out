## How it works

The project takes in the index of Fibonacci number to generate (`n=0` -> 1, `n=1` -> 1,...).
Where `n` is an 8-bit unsigned integer on the `n[7:0]` pins. To start generating the sequence `start_stb` should be asserted for one clock cycle.
While the module is working, the `busy` signal will be asserted. After the `busy` signal falls to `0`, the Nth Fibonacci number is available on `fib[7:0]` pins
